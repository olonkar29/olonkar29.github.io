        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> First year CSE PhD student at the University of Caliornia, Santa Cruz. My research is focused in Computer Architecture and Graph Algorithms.
            I am advised by Dr. Scott Beamer. I did my undergrad in Computer Engineering at UCSB. In my spare time, I like to ride bikes, climb rocks, lift heavy things
            and walk up mountains.
